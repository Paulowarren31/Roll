#WAT DO

make sure to:

pip install django-allauth
pip install django-friendship

What we got so far:

1. you can login w FB and look at all the sick bets at /bets/
2. you can view individual bets at bet/x. x is the id of the bet
3. you can log out
4. facebook friends. Add created users at /add/:id
5. All FB friends that are also registered on the app show up under the extra_data field
   on the SocialAccounts
6. Bet creation form


What we need:

2. auto-add friends from facebook
4. something on the homepage? 
6. Bet logic (what to do when we reach bets time date, how to get people to accept the outcome, how to decide winners and losers and distribute points accordingly.
